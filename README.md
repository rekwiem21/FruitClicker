FruitClicker

A simple clicker game that's all about fruit!

Made by Jayden Collis for a friend however this is now being prepared to be sold on steam!

Simply run the EXE file once downloaded. To close this app, not only do you have to close the main window, you must quit it in the task manager. The team are actively working to fix this issue.
